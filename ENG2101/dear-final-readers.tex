Dear Readers.

My rough draft was not \textit{very} complete, by any means.
While I had a vague direction of the essay in mind, but it was very difficult to crystallize something concrete out of this ``direction''.
I wanted to write an essay based on the experiences I have had with virtual reality.
As a long-time VR fan, the idea of ``being in the online world'' was very appealing to me.

However, due to personal complications towards the end of the semester, I was overburdened with work, which continued even after the last day of the class.
(In fact, I am writing this letter after working at a conference as a staff.)

I believe I have pretty solid thesis statement.
However, since I was not able to work on this essay continuously, I believe the argument is a bit ``jumpy'' occasionally.
If I were given more time, I would like to fix the jumpy arguments and smooth things out.

\noindent
Sincerely,

\noindent
Juhun Lee.
