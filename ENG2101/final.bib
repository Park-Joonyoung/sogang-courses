The play Water by the Spoonful presents post war events in Elliot’s life consisting of the difficulties he faces as a result of his having been abandoned by his mother as a child andwounded in the war. Elliot’s memories and present troubles and frustrations make him isolate, and his effort to understand and solve them leads to suffering, regret, and intolerance. While Elliot is trying to face his problems in real life, other characters choose to build walls around their past and real identities. The play also reveals how fragile the characters beyond the walls of loneliness and virtual identity are and re- establishes a new order.}, number={1}, publisher={Editura Universitaria Craiova}, author={Anghel, Florentina}, year={2021}, pages={5–15}, collection={Annals of the University of Craiova, Series: Philology, English} }

Of special interest to researchers is the increased importance that anonymity seems to play in computer-mediated communication (CMC). This paper reviews the literature related to the issues of anonymity within the social context, particularly in CMC, demonstrating the usefulness of established social psychological theory to explain behavior in CMC and discussing the evolution of the current theoretical explanations in explaining the effects of anonymity in social behavior in CMC environments. Several suggestions for future research are proposed in an attempt to provide researchers with new avenues to investigate how anonymity can play both positive and negative roles in CMC.}, number={6}, author={Christopherson, Kimberly M.}, year={2007}, month={Nov}, pages={3038–3056}, collection={Computers in human behavior} }

More specifically, it contends that Quiara Alegría Hudes’s play Water by the Spoonful illuminates the violence of neoliberal dispossession through its cast of characters who can be read as failed entrepreneurial subjects. If neoliberal reason views individuals as self-appreciating entrepreneurs, the play suggests that entrepreneurial self-extension is a broken form of living. To examine the play’s treatment of failure, this article draws on Emmanuel Levi-nas’s philosophy of ethics, arguing that the play displays an ethico- political commitment to the future, one in which collective living would supplant the egoistic pursuits abetted by neoliberal reason.}, number={3}, publisher={Johns Hopkins University Press}, author={Dufournaud, Daniel}, year={2020}, month={Jun}, pages={441–467}, collection={College literature} }

The playwright combines a lyrical ear with a sophisticated sense of structure to trace the legacy of war through three generations of a Puerto Rican family. Without ever invoking politics, Elliot, a Soldier’s Fugue manages to be a deeply poetic, touching and often funny indictment of the war in Iraq.”— The New York Times From Quiara Alegria Hudes, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Water by the Spoonful, comes this companion play, itself a Pulitzer finalist. In a crumbling urban lot that has been converted into a verdant sanctuary, a young Marine comes to terms with his father’s service in Vietnam as he decides whether to leave for a second tour of duty in Iraq. Melding a poetic dreamscape with a stream-of-consciousness narrative, Elliot, A Soldier’s Fugue takes us on an unforgettable journey across time and generations, lyrically tracing the legacy of war on a single Puerto Rican family. Elliot, A Soldier’s Fugue, a finalist for the 2007 Pulitzer Prize, is the first installment in a trilogy of plays that follow Elliot’s return from Iraq. The second play, Water by the Spoonful, received the 2012 Pulitzer Prize and will be published by Theatre Communications Group concurrently with Elliot, A Soldier’s Fugue. The trilogy’s final play, The Happiest Song Plays Last, premiered in April 2012 at Chicago’s renowned The Goodman Theatre.}, publisher={Theatre Communications Group}, author={Hudes, Quiara Alegría}, year={2012} }

There’s live music, but oh, how the lines sing too.” — David Cote, Time Out New York “Ms. Hudes draws all her characters with precision and understanding... this warm-blooded play underscores how the disorienting flux of life can be navigated with the help of carefully tended family ties.” — Charles Isherwood, New York Times “Delightful... Hudes is a very accomplished storyteller, a playwright with an emergent, fulsome American narrative.” — Chris Jones, Chicago Tribune At the dawn of the Arab Spring in an ancient Jordinian town, an Iraq War veteran struggles to overcome the traumas of combat by taking on an entirely new and unexpected career: an action-film hero. At the same time, halfway around the world in a cozy North Philadelphia kitchen, his cousin takes on a heroic new role of her own: as the heart and soul of her crumbling community, providing hot meals and an open door for the needy.The final installment in Hudes’s three-play cycle, which began with the Pulitzer Prize-finalist Elliot, A Soldier’s Fugue and Pulitzer Prize-winner Water By the Spoonful, The Happiest Song Plays Last is about the search for redemption, humility and one’s place in the world. Quiara Alegria Hudes is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Water by the Spoonful, the Tony Award- winning musical In the Heights and the Pulitzer Prize finalist Elliot, A Soldier’s Fugue.

This article discusses research on Internet social interaction in terms of the following questions: What predicts who will look for and form social relationships on the Internet and who won’t? How do people present themselves to others over the Internet? How is social interaction on the Internet similar and different from the more traditional forms of interaction? And what are the consequences of participating in Internet groups and interacting with others one-on-one for the individual’s self concept and social relationships? The conceptual framework offered here organizes research on the social psychology of the Internet into three time phases (before, during, and after extensive social interactions and group participation) and two distinct types of motivations that drive Internet social behavior (self-related and socially related). After a review of the research on these issues so far we conclude that there is an abundance of interacting going on out there in cyberspace, and it is having surprisingly strong effects on people’s “real life.”}, number={3}, author={McKenna, Katelyn Y.
